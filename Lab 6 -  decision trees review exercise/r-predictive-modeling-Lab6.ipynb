On average, each sample has a ~63.2% chance of showing up at least once in a bootstrap sample. Some samples won't show up at all, and these _held out_ samples are the ones that are used for testing the performance of the trained model.

Here, a subset of your data (e.g., 4/5ths, or 80%) is used for training, and the remaining 1/5th or 20% is used for performance assessment. You slide the cross-validation interval over and use the next 4/5ths for training and 1/5th for testing. You do this again for all 5ths of the data. You can optionally repeat this process many times (_repeated cross-validation_) to get an average cross validation prediction accuracy for a given model and set of tuning parameters.\n",

It's not doing any pre-processing like centering or scaling, and it's doing bootstrap resampling of 77 samples with replacement, repeated 25 times each. Random Forest has a single tuning parameter, $m_{\\text{try}}$ -- the algorithm will select $m_{\\text{try}}$ number of predictors to attempt a split for classification when building a classification tree. The caret package does 25 bootstrap resamples for different values of $m_{\\text{try}}$ (you can also control this too if you want), and computes [accuracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity#Confusion_matrix) and [kappa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohen%27s_kappa) measures of performance on the held-out samples. \n",

For continuous outcomes, you can measure things like RMSE or correlation coefficients.\n",

    "> **_A bit about random forests._** Random forests are an ensemble learning approach based on classification trees. The CART (classification and regression tree) method searches through all available predictors to try to find a value of a single variable that splits the data into two groups by minimizing the impurity of the outcome between the two groups. The process is repeated over and over again until a hierarchical (tree) structure is created. But trees don't have great performance (prediction accuracy) compared to other models. Small changes in the data can drastically affect the structure of the tree. \n",
    "> \n",
    "> Tree algorithms are improved by ensemble approaches - instead of growing a single tree, grow many trees and aggregate (majority vote or averaging) the predictions made by the ensemble. The random forest algorithm is essentially:\n",
    "> \n",
    "> 1. From the training data of _n_ samples, draw a bootstrap sample of size _n_.\n",
    "> 1. For each bootstrap sample, grow a classification tree, but with a small modification compared to the traditional algorithm: instead of selecting from all possible predictor variables to form a split, choose the best split among a randomly selected subset of $m_{\\text{try}}$ predictors. Here, $m_{\\text{try}}$ is the only tuning parameter. The trees are grown to their maximum size and not \"pruned\" back.\n",
    "> 1. Repeat the steps agove until a large number of trees is grown. \n",
    "> 1. Estimate the performance of the ensemble of trees using the \"out-of-bag\" samples - i.e., those that were never selected during the bootstrap procedure in step #1. \n",
    "> 1. Estimate the importance of each variable in the model by randomly permuting each predictor variable in testing on the out-of-bag samples. If a predictor is important, prediction accuracy will degrade. If the predictor isn't that helpful, performance doesn't deteriorate as much. \n",
    "> \n",
    "> Random forests are efficient compared to growing a single tree. For one, the RF algorithm only selects from $m_{\\text{try}}$ predictors at each step, rather than all available predictors. Usually $m_{\\text{try}}$ is by default somewhere close to the square root of the total number of available predictors, so the search is very fast. Second, while the traditional CART tree algorithm has to go through extensive cross-validation based pruning to avoid overfitting, the RF algorithm doesn't do any pruning at all. In fact, building an RF model _can_ be faster than building a single tree!\n",
    "\n",
    "Caret also provides a function for [assessing the importance of each variable](http://topepo.github.io/caret/variable-importance.html). The `varImp` function knows what kind of model was fitted and knows how to estimate variable importance. For Random Forest, it's an estimate of how much worse the prediction gets after randomly shuffling the values of each predictor variable in turn. A variable that's important will result in a much worse prediction than a variable that's not as meaningful."

Perhaps this is due to a change in surveillance or reporting strategy. You also see the yearly trend, which makes sense for flu outbreaks. You also noticed that when we originally fit the model, daily and weekly seasonality was disabled. This makes sense for broad time-scale things like influenza surveillance over decades, but you might enable it for more granular time-series data."
